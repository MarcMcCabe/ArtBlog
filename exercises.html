                <h3>Don't Look Now!</h3>
                <p style="max-width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; padding-bottom: 10px;">This exercise is good for improving your observational skills and also for taking your mind off the details. As you draw dont look at your page, only look at the subject you are drawing. This is best done from life, get a real object in front of you and starting from the center of the page, pick a spot on your subject and begin. It helps with concentration as you are only thinking about the subject and not how your drawing is looking.

                <p style="max-width: 100%; margin: 0 auto; padding-bottom: 10px;">Find a photo to copy from and turn it upside-down. This works well for faces, as when we try to draw a face we can get caught up in getting the likeness right. For this exercise just focus on the shapes that you see. Having the photo upside-down helps you to forget about the likeness of the person and just concentrate on getting the shapes right. Are they the right size and in the right place, are the proportions correct. Try to just keep going, dont erase very often. When you get the end turn your drawing the right way up, you may be surprised at the accuracy you achieved.

                    <p style="max-width: 50%; margin: 0; padding-right: 10px; float:left">This is a quick and fun exercise that helps build your understanding of line work. The idea is to never lift your pen/pencil off the page, the whole drawing is done with one continuous line. This is more difficult than you would think, don't worry about messing up either because it will happen. The interesting thing is finding the lines on your subject to get from one point to another. You are not allowed to make random lines that aren't there. Only draw what you see, follow the form with your eye and draw in sync with you eye. This is a great way to build patience and careful attention to your work. <br></p>

                <p style="max-width: 100%; margin: 0; padding-right: 10px; ">The idea of this exercise is to draw the shapes outside of your subject. In drawing and painting that space can often be as important as the main content. Practicing this will give you a better understanding of composition and how objects overlap. Simply draw only the shapes that are created by the edge of your subject. Plants are often used for this exercise for their many overlapping and intertwining shapes. Remember this isnt just about drawing the outline of your subject, think of the subject as the secondary focus, your primary concern are the shapes it creates outside of itself.

                <p style="max-width: 100%; margin: 0; padding-right: 10px; ">Gesture drawing is all about capturing the pose with as few strokes as possible. Your lines should be expressive and dynamic. The drawings should be fast and fluid. Dont overthink it, just go off instinct. You will learn to get the feeling of a pose and be able to capture that feeling within your drawing. Don't worry about any mistakes, just start a new drawing and keep going. There is no right or wrong answer, gesture drawing isnt not about analyzing the subject and drawing it perfectly. Observe your subject and let your intuition guide you.
